    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      At different times and different circumstances of our lives, we fulfill
      different roles and responsibilities. Here are some of the roles I’ve
      fulfilled:
    </p>
    <h2>LIFELONG LEARNER</h2>
    <p>
      Having spent 17 years in education, I managed to walk away with a piece of
      paper that said “Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy Honours and Commerce
      Minor”. I also received a piece of paper that said I owed a lot of money
      to the government, but I tend to dislike talking about that. Seriously
      though, learning is important, and at this point, is second-nature to me.
      I’m a big fan of small, quotidian learning.
    </p>
    <h2>PHILOSOPHER</h2>
    <p>
      I label myself this, but I often question it also. This title is mostly
      given, rather than self-proclaimed. Many other people have this belief
      that if you took philosophy courses in university, you’re automatically a
      philosopher. Perhaps this is true, but I myself see the title as
      prestigious, and I don’t quite think I’ve earned it with a simple
      undergraduate degree. But if you are interested—and I hope you are!—I have
      a short introduction to philosophy as a subject here.
    </p>
    <h2>BUDGET TRAVELLER</h2>
    <p>
      This is a great topic and title. I’ve done my fair share of travelling,
      and a part of me deep, deep inside both hate and love travelling. At the
      root, travelling is symbolic of forsaking the familiar and seeking the
      uncomfortable. Travelling doesn’t have to be expensive. For example,
      RyanAir in Europe offers questionably low air fares; I’ve often paid 20
      Euros to fly from country to country. With a backpack and plenty of time
      to research the budget-friendly options ahead of time, travelling can be
      easy on the wallet.
    </p>
    <h2>CALCULATED RISK-TAKER</h2>
    <p>
      Doing nothing is boring. Going all-in is scary. So I settle in between.
      Does that make sense?
